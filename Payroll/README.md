Payroll System
Write a C++ application to a company that has several types of employees, e.g.: employees who get paid a fixed salary as may be weekly or monthly. Another type could be employees who are paid per hour, and they could get overtime pay. Also, there might be employees who get paid based on commission according to their sales for example. 
Your task is to write an application that handles these operations polymorphically as illustrated in the class today.
